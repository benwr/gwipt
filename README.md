# gwipt

Automatic work-in-progress commits with descriptive commit messages generated
by LLMs.

Never again worry about the tension between "commit early, commit often" and
"every commit needs a commit message". All you need is an OpenAI API key, and
gwipt will track every single change in your working directory, on a parallel
`wip/` branch.

## Usage

Make sure the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set to your personal
API key. Then, `cd` into the repository, and...

```bash
gwipt
```

Boom! As long as the program is running, every change you make in the working
tree is now saved, with a descriptive commit message that will be printed to
stdout. Say you're on branch `A`; then all your changes (including untracked
files) will be automatically committed to `wip/A`, and you can explore them
whenever you want.

You can see a few testing examples in the
[wip/main](https://github.com/benwr/gwipt/commits/wip/main) branch of this
repository. Every commit there that starts with `wip:` was generated by GPT-3.
This is new and untested software, but I'm pleased enough with the results that
I'm already using it for my personal projects.

## Installation

```bash
cargo install gwipt
```
